Jump to any word in your current view super fast.\n\n* * *\n\n**Note:** this package is a partial rewrite of the great [easy-motion package](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion) from Adrian Budau.\n\nThe original package seems dead and, with the deprecation of the atom API pre-1.0, it's sad that we can't use easy-motion in atom anymore. So, i rewrite the package, waiting for news from Adrian.\n\n* * *\n\nCheck out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.\n\nTo start easy-motion press **Shift+Cmd+E**. Rebind this in settings to better suit you. By default the characters that replace words are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.\n\n**Note:** the package is like *in beta*, since the original code used many features that has been deprecated with the atom API v1.0. Don't hesitate to report issues & bugs, or submit pull requests to help me maintain this package.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/leny/atom-easy-motion-redux/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/leny/atom-easy-motion-redux#readme","_id":"easy-motion-redux@0.0.4","_shasum":"409420b3a0f3bee809a73400d0949e4d5a75fc06","_resolved":"file:../d-115912-5805-172euyr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115912-5805-172euyr/package.tgz"}
